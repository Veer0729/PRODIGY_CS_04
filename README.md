# Simple Keylogger

When you run this script, it will:

1. Listen for keyboard events using the pynput library.
2. Call the keypressed function whenever a key is pressed.
3. Print the pressed key to the console.
4.Try to write the character representation of the pressed key to a log file called keyfile.txt.
5. If the key is a modifier key, print an error message to the console.
6. Continue running and listening for keyboard events until the script is manually stopped.
Note that this script is a keylogger, and using it to monitor someone's keyboard activity without their consent is likely illegal and unethical.
